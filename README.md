# Proxy configuration for developers

When working in a bigger company, you probably will need to configure your tools to bypass the corporate proxy.

Depending on your operating system and programs different configurations might be needed.

## Basics

Let's assume that your proxy consist out of the following parts:

- user
- pass
- host
- port

This results in a proxy URL: http://user:pass@host:port or if the proxy doesn't need authentication the simpler version http://host:port might be sufficient.
